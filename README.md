# AbevBot - Another Twitch Bot

Two versions are available:
 - **Console** - Mostly a console window with added SFML package for low level graphical interface. Can easly create RenderWindow in which you can display shapes / sprites with textures and create animations. With few tweaks (like chaning ngrok.exe reference to ngrok.sh) can be build for operating systems other than Windows.
 - **WPF** - Almost the same as Console version but uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). WPF is used instead of SFML which grants higher level of abstracion on graphical interface (like premade user controls). Can display videos and play audio clips. Because WPF is used can be build only for Windows.
